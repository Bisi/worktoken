/**
 * <p><b>Exclusive Gateway</b> implementation.</p>
 *
 * <p>A diverging Exclusive Gateway (Decision) is used to create alternative paths within a Process flow. This is
 * basically the "diversion point in the road" for a Process. For a given instance of the Process, only one of the paths
 * can be taken.</p>
 *
 * <p><img src="doc-files/xgwy.png"/></p>
 *
 * <p>A Decision can be thought of as a question that is asked at a particular point in the Process. The question has a
 * defined set of alternative answers. Each answer is associated with a condition Expression that is associated with a
 * Gatewayâ€™s outgoing Sequence Flows.</p>
 *
 * <p>A default path can optionally be identified, to be taken in the event that none of the conditional Expressions
 * evaluate to true. If a default path is not specified and the Process is executed such that none of the conditional
 * Expressions evaluates to true, a runtime exception occurs.</p>
 *
 * <p>The ExclusiveGateway class provides default implementation of <em>tokenIn()</em>, which selects outgoing connector
 * by matching connector names and value of token variable with a name matching the gateway's name.</p>
